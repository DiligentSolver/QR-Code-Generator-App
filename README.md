# QR-Code-Generator-App

The project entitled “QR Code Generator” is an Android Application to generate QR Code. QR Codes were originally invented to replace Barcodes as they can store more information and are easier to scan. Now, QR Codes have a wide range of uses across all types of industries such as in education, marketing, and logistics. Initially, the objective and scopes for our project work are presented. Besides, the problem statement and solution approach are discussed. Furthermore, the subsequent chapters will explain more about this project work.

1. Objective

Our main objective for the project entitled “QR Code generator” is to allow users to create QR Code which is simply content (text, URL, etc.) encoded into the QR Code. By generating QR codes we are giving the way to go to create a link between the real-world products (tagged with the QR code) and the Internet. Mobile, anywhere, anytime. Because QR codes make it so easy to transfer a web link to a mobile phone, they provide a significantly lower barrier to visit a site with a smart phone. But you can also work with other texts and data, such as advertising messages, telephone numbers and UPI id to give priority to cashless payments. Just encode them with our QR Code Generator to easily transfer the data to mobile devices to make heavy text (such as URL, Payment URL, Tickets, etc.) information into a scannable format.

2. Scopes

By using QR Code Generator Application, we will encode the user’s information (text, URL, Payment URL, etc.) into bi-dimensional code (QR Code). You can store short texts, SMS, all kinds of URLs and websites (YouTube, Facebook, Homepages), contact detail, dates, telephone numbers, email messages, Wi-Fi access credentials, geo and navigation data and much more. Your text files or password system could be encrypted into QR Code and can be read by any other scanner app or mobile device, etc. You may take screenshot of your generated QR code or embed it on your website or any other platform to make it available to others.

3. Problem Statement

Generating a QR code and developing a QR code generator which will be used for user purpose. As we know that scanner is already inbuilt in smartphones but there is no QR generator app for encoding user’s content into QR code. So that we are going to develop an android application which would be able to generate the QR code. This project is also intended to small businesses which would use this technology for marketing purpose. 

4. Solution Approach in brief 

To create a QR Code at user end in smartphones, we developed an android application “QR Code Generator”. By using this app user can generate QR Code within few seconds.
